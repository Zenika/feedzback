# Feedback draft

## User story

When I reply to a feedback request or give spontaneous feedback, if I can't complete my feedback in one go, I'd like to be able to save it as a draft and continue later.

## Technical specifications

The drafts are stored in the `feedbackDraft` Firestore collection.

In this collection, the document ID is the `giverEmail` (who wrote and saved the draft), whether he is internal or external to the Zenika organisation.

For a given `giverEmail`, there can be 2 nested collections:

- `feedbackRequest`: contains drafts saved when replying to a feedback request
- `feedback`: contains drafts saved when giving a spontaneous feedback

### `feedbackRequest` drafts

In this collection, the document ID is the `tokenId` and the document contains the following fields:

```ts
const feedbackRequestDraft: FeedbackRequestDraft = {
  token: '123secret', // Redondant data - same value as the document ID itself
  receiverEmail: 'pinochio@zenika.com', // Redondant data - already available in the original `FeedbackRequest` document

  // ----------------------------
  // The relevant data start here
  positive: 'You did great...', // Might be empty because its just a draft
  negative: '', // Might be empty because its just a draft
  comment: '',
};
```

:::note
The redundant field `receiverEmail` has been added to be able to display the list of drafts by recipient.

### `feedback` drafts

In this collection, the document ID is the `receiverEmail` and the document contains the following fields:

```ts
const feedbackDraft: FeedbackDraft = {
  receiverEmail: 'pinochio@zenika.com', // Redondant data - same value as the document ID itself

  // ----------------------------
  // The relevant data start here
  positive: 'You did great...', // Might be empty because its just a draft
  negative: '', // Might be empty because its just a draft
  comment: '',
  shared: true,
};
```
