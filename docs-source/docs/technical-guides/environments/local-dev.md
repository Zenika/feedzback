# Local dev environment

As explained in the [installation guide](/docs/installation), you can run the _client_ and _server_ apps locally, for development purposes.
But you are still connecting to the remote `feedzback-v2-dev` Firebase project for Authentication and Firestore services.

The good news is that you can run the entire stack locally, using the [Firebase emulator suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite)!

:::note
All scripts related to Firebase emulator can be found in the `<rootDir>/client/package.json` file.
:::

:::info
When using the Firebase emulator, the Google Auth provider is no longer available.
Only the Email/Password provider is enabled.

## `*:emulators` scripts

In this execution context, the _client_ and _server_ apps are running in "watch" mode.

Only the Firebase _Auth_ and _Firestore_ emulators are started. The _Hosting_ emulator is not used in this context.

Here are the NPM scripts for this execution context:

```json title="<rootDir>/client/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // Start Firebase "Auth" and "Firestore" emulators
    "firebase:emulators": "firebase emulators:start --only auth:dev,firestore:dev --import ./firebase-emulators-data",

    // Start the server app in "watch" mode
    "server:emulators": "npm --prefix ../server run start:emulators",

    // Start the client app in "watch" mode
    "start:emulators": "ng serve -c development-emulators",

    // ----------------------------------------
    // Run all the previous scripts in parallel
    "stack:emulators": "concurrently \"npm run firebase:emulators\" \"npm run server:emulators\" \"npm run start:emulators\""
  }
}
```

## `*:e2e` scripts

In this execution context, the _client_ and _server_ apps are built before running.

This time, not only are the Firebase _Auth_ and _Firestore_ emulators started, but so is the _Hosting_ emulator that serves the client app.
Therefore, the client app must be built beforehand, to be available in the `<rootDir>/client/dist/browser` directory.

This environment is the closest to the production environment (with the exception of the authentication method) and is therefore ideal for [E2E testing](/docs/technical-guides/e2e-testing).

Here are the NPM scripts for this execution context:

```json title="<rootDir>/client/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // Start Firebase "Auth", "Firestore" and "Hosting" emulators
    "firebase:e2e": "firebase emulators:start --only auth:dev,firestore:dev,hosting:dev --import ./firebase-emulators-data",

    // Build and start the server app (see "<rootDir>/server/package.json" scripts for details)
    "server:e2e": "npm --prefix ../server run start:e2e",

    // Only build the client app (it will be served by Firebase "Hosting")
    "prestack:e2e": "npm run build:e2e",

    // ----------------------------------------
    // Run all the previous scripts in parallel
    "stack:e2e": "concurrently \"npm run firebase:e2e\" \"npm run server:e2e\""
  }
}
```
